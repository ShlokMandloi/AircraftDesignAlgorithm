# AircraftDesignAlgorithm
This algorithm was made to automate an aircraft design selection process specifically for the SAE Aero Design competition. This code outputs an optimal design based on FlightScore as the fitness function, taking structured data from CFD as the input. It optimises the take-off distance, aircraft empty weight, avionics' inputs and payload capacity. 
The code was made on Python and MATLAB, howeever, only the MATLAB (.m) files have been uploaded.
